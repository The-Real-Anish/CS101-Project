# Bubble Trouble

This is a game made as a course project for CS101 in my 1st semester. The game concept is simple and requires you to shoot bubbles using a shooter. I made use of the [simplecpp](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ranade/simplecpp) library for graphics.

# Features

* All required features were implemented, including parabolic bubble motion and collisions between bubbles and the bullet/shooter.

* I created 4 levels with a level count.
 *  Levels 2 and 3 contain larger bubbles that split into smaller bubbles.
 *  The final level has a boss bubble that moves horizontally and spawns in a bubble every few seconds, including one at the beginning.
 *  This boss has a health counter and has 20 health. After it loses all its health it splits into 2 bubbles.
